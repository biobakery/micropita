#This is the way significance is given to the Tax/OTU in the cladogram
#The three possible values are ABS, PVALUE, FDR
#ABS Shows TAXA/OTUs that are present in the selected population of samples with an abundance of more than 0.
#PVALUE shows the TAXA/OTUS that are differentially enriched in selected or not selected samples and shown if the pvalue of the rank sum nonparametric t-test is less than or equal to 0.05
#FDR extends PVALUE by adding a Benjamini and Hochberg FDR to the pvalue and showing all values equal to or less than 0.1

#This is the threshold used on the p-value or q-value for defining enrichment in sample features

## Validation #################################################################
#This is the information describing a data set which will be used to "validate" results from this micropita run
#This needs to be a paired dataset
#A series of images will be produced depending on the micropita selection method
#Highest diversity will produce a image that is the measure of the diversity of selected and not selected population in the new dataset
#Targeted feature will produce a figure that is the feature abundance in selected and not selected population in the new dataset
#Most representative will perform a PCoA showing the spread of the selected samples in in the validation data set.
#Most dissimilar will do the same as most representative
#Supervised methods (discriminant and distinct) will do the same as most representative but in sample groups by label
